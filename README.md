# Arithmetic expression binary tree
 
This repository contains the Java code for a program that constructs a binary expression tree from a user-input arithmetic expression. The program validates the expression, displays the resulting tree in different traversal orders, and computes the expression's result using the binary tree.

## Features

The program offers the following options in a menu:

1. **Input arithmetic expression (infix notation):** The user enters an expression in infix notation. The expression is validated, and a message is displayed indicating whether it is valid or invalid.
2. **Create binary expression tree:** The entered infix expression is converted into a binary expression tree.
3. **Display binary expression tree:** The tree is displayed in three different traversals:
   - Pre-order
   - In-order
   - Post-order
4. **Calculate expression:** The tree is traversed to compute the expression. The result is displayed on the screen.
5. **Exit the program:** Ends the program execution.

## Expression Requirements

- The expression must contain only integers and/or decimal numbers, parentheses, and the following binary operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`.
- Valid expressions will be processed, while invalid expressions will result in an error message.
